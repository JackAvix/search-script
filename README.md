A tiny script to generate uBlock Origin filters.

# How to Use

- Pull the repo and add the companies you want filtered under the "Company Name" column header in the "job_list.csv" file.
- Run the "block_generator.py" script and import the 'blocked_companies.txt' file to the 'My filters' tab of Ublock Origin to block them from your Linkedin searches.
